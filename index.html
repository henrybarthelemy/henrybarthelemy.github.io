        <br>
        <p class="info">My name is Henry Barthelemy. I'm currently a third year pursuing a Computer Science and
            Mathematics BS at Northeastern University. I'm in the plus one program and graduating with a BS+MS in Spring 2025.
            I’m passionate about helping make a difference in the educational, technology, and computability, and love intersecting all my
            interests. </p>
        <p class="info"> I started coding in Java by creating minecraft mods and plugins for servers from 2015-2018. I
            continued coding and it became an integral part of my life. I founded a computer science club at my high
            school and began teaching at a STEM camp in the summer of 2019. Additionally, that summer I made two games:
            "Life is Currency" and "Tag!". Life is Currency was created using the Pygame python library, I had learned I
            was going to be teaching python and wanted to brush up on my skills. Tag! is a 2D game I created for my
            advanced Java class to code which uses the Java Swing and AWT libraries. </p>
        <p class = "info">
            I’m planning on participate in an undergraduate research project in computer science this Spring. I
            love the interdisciplinary space between mathematics and computer science and am looking forward to diving more into
            that in a research capacity.
        </p>
        <p class="info"> This website will serve as a centralized hub for projects I’m working on! I'll try to update it 
            whenever I'm on a break. Feel free to check out my projects page to see the cool stuff I'm doing!
