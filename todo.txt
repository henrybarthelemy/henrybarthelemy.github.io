Todo List:
- Finish classes page (grid layout of classes taken)
    -> feature to add later: notes for classes where I have a good note taking track
- Finish contact page
- Finish home page
- Abstract stuff
    -> the projects with the cards into a easy layout, maybe json to html? (possibly mixing react.js with typescript and cards from bootstrap)
    -> nav bar (maybe Django??)
