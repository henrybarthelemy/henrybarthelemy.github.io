        <h1 class="title">About </h1>
        <br>
        <p class="info">My name is Henry Barthelemy. I'm currently a second year pursuing a Computer Science and
            Mathematics BS with a minor in Environmental Studies at Northeastern University. I’m passionate about
            helping make a difference in the humanities fight against climate change and love intersecting all my
            interests. </p>
        <p class="info"> I started coding in Java by creating minecraft mods and plugins for servers from 2015-2018. I
            continued coding and it became an integral part of my life. I founded a computer science club at my high
            school and began teaching at a STEM camp in the summer of 2019. Additionally, that summer I made two games:
            "Life is Currency" and "Tag!". Life is Currency was created using the Pygame python library, I had learned I
            was going to be teaching python and wanted to brush up on my skills. Tag! is a 2D game I created for my
            advanced Java class to code which uses the Java Swing and AWT libraries. </p>
        <p class="info"> I’ve recently been getting into coding financial analysis tools with APIs and am currently
            creating a bot to trade paper money with following these algorithms, you can find this on-going project on
            my github page. I just joined Northeasterns Finnovate, a fintech club. 
        </p>
        <p class = "info">
            Furthermore, I’d like to participate in an undergraduate research project in mathematics. I
            love the interdisciplinary space between mathematics and computer science and would love to dive more into
            that in a research capacity. I've joined a group on campus at Northeastern to learn how to program in Lean.
        </p>
        <p class="info"> Other than coding, I’m very passionate about battling our current climate crisis. I’m learning
            GIS and hope to be able to battle climate change as a Computer Scientist on multiple fronts. </p>
        <p class="info"> This website is under construction (this is a very very very early draft, essentially just here
            just to have something up, and will soon get replaced by a much nicer looking version that I am currently
            working on). This website will serve as a centralized hub for projects I’m working on! </p>
